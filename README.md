<h1 align = "center"> Python Challenge </h1>

In the Python Challenge project, we've delved into two critical tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. In PyBank, my Python script thoroughly analysed financial records stored in `budget_data.csv`. This dataset captured key metrics over time, including total months recorded, net profit/losses, average changes in profits, and identified both the greatest increase and decrease in profits along with their respective dates. This script not only automated the analysis of financial data but also provided insightful metrics crucial for financial decision-making.

Turning our attention to PyPoll, our Python script tackled election data housed in `election_data.csv`. This dataset contained voter IDs, counties, and candidate names. Using Python, we calculated the total number of votes cast, compiled a list of candidates who received votes, computed each candidate's vote percentage and total count, and ultimately determined the winner based on the highest number of votes. This automated approach streamlined the analysis of election results, providing clear insights into voter preferences and election outcomes.

Through these challenges, the Python Challenge project demonstrated the power of Python in handling and analysing real-world datasets with efficiency and accuracy. By automating these tasks, Python proves invaluable in simplifying complex data analysis and decision-making processes.

## Criteria

<b> PyBank Criteria: </b>
```
- In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the nancial records of your company. You will be given a nancial dataset called `budget_data.csv`. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

- Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    - The greatest increase in pro ts (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in pro ts (date and amount) over the entire period
```

<b> PyPoll Criteria: </b>
```
- You will be given a set of poll data called `election_data.csv`. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
    - The total number of votes cast
    - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total number of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote
```
